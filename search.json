    "text": "Authors: Ward Haegeman, Giuseppe Orlando, Samuel Kokh, Marc Massot\n\nThe goal here is to demonstrate the feasability of numerical simulations of a new all-topology two-fluid model (Haegeman et al. 2025) using a standard first-order finite-volume scheme.\nHereafter, we provide the abstract of the contribution in which the model is derived, as well as a link to the full preprint. Next, details on the numerical scheme used and its implementation using the open-source Samurai library are given before listing the numerical test cases. At the end of this web-page, all the information necessary to install and run the code in order to reproduce the numerical data can be found.\n\nAbstract\nWe present a novel multi-fluid model for compressible two-phase flows. The model is derived through a newly developed Stationary Action Principle framework. It is fully closed and introduces a new interfacial quantity, the interfacial work. The closures for the interfacial quantities are provided by the variational principle. They are physically sound and well-defined for all type of flow topologies. The model is shown to be hyperbolic, symmetrizable, and admits an entropy conservation law. Its non-conservative products yield uniquely defined jump conditions which are provided. As such, it allows for the proper treatment of weak solutions. In the multi-dimensional setting, the model presents lift forces which are discussed. The model constitutes a sound basis for future numerical simulations.\nPreprint available at HAL-05249139\n\n\nNumerical method and implementation\nThe model has been implemented without the contributions related to the lift forces. We refer to (Haegeman et al. 2025) for a complete description of the model. Our implementation corresponds to a finite volume method on structured meshes represented by cartesian grids. On each inter-cell interface, the numerical flux is computed using an approximate Rieman solver. Here, we use the first-order non-conservative Rusanov scheme presented in (Crouzet et al. 2013). Under a standard CFL condition, the scheme is positivity-preserving for the volume fraction and phasic densities.\n\n\nList of test cases\nThree types of test cases are available, a one-dimensional Riemann problem and a two-dimensional Riemann problem.
